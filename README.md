> This branch contains the NeoForge edition for Minecraft 26.1.2. The Forge edition for Minecraft 1.20.1 is maintained on the [`1.20.1-forge`](https://github.com/R-Eatch/howling-werewolf/tree/1.20.1-forge) branch.

Howling Werewolf 1.1.5 completes the Minecraft 26.1.2 port of the 1.1.3 feature set. It targets stable NeoForge 26.1.2.122 and Java 25, with updated rendering, persistence, recipes, world generation, item animations, and spawn egg artwork.

Howling Werewolf is an independently developed transformation and progression Mod built around infection, lunar transformations, two progression systems, three werewolf forms, Hunters and Silver, Wolfsbane, and the Alpha Trial.

## Requirements

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| Minecraft Java Edition | 26.1.2 |
| Mod loader | NeoForge 26.1.2.122 or later compatible 26.1.2.x release |
| Java | 25 |
| Howling Werewolf | 1.1.5 |

## Werewolf skins

- Open the werewolf menu with **K** by default → **Skins** to choose from four coats: the original brown Adrian, gray Ashen with amber eyes, black Onyx with golden eyes, or white Ivory with red eyes. Each covers Werewolf, Quadruped Wolf, and Beast forms.
- Preview with mouse tracking, drag rotation, scroll-wheel zoom, and an equipment toggle, then apply your selection. Previewing does not unlock or activate a form. Level Reset is below the skill list on the Skill Tree page.
- Your selection persists through death, dimension changes, level resets, and curing/reawakening. Third-person rendering, inventory previews, and first-person claws share the same skin.
- Create a painting template and open Resource Packs from the skin screen to enable your own PNG skins. Reload edits with **F3 + T**. See the [custom skin guide](CUSTOM_SKINS.md) ([简体中文](CUSTOM_SKINS-zh.md)).

Update both server and clients to 1.1.5 for multiplayer. Only custom skin IDs are synchronized; observers need the same resource pack. Missing packs display Adrian while preserving the saved selection.

## Spawn eggs and item animations

![Werewolf, Hunter, and Moon-Crowned Alpha Werewolf spawn eggs](docs/spawn-eggs.png)

- Werewolf and Hunter spawn eggs now use distinct 16×16 artwork following Minecraft 26.1.2's mob-specific egg style.
- The new **Moon-Crowned Alpha Werewolf Spawn Egg** is in the mod's creative tab and is available as `howlingwerewolf:alpha_werewolf_spawn_egg`. It spawns the same boss entity used by the Alpha Trial. A boss spawned this way is independent of the ritual and does not grant ritual completion rewards.
- Spear use now follows the native ready/holding animation in Werewolf and Beast forms. Tridents retain their separate throwing charge pose.
