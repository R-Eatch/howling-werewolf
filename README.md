> This branch contains the NeoForge edition for Minecraft 1.21.1. The Forge edition for Minecraft 1.20.1 is maintained on the [`1.20.1-forge`](https://github.com/R-Eatch/howling-werewolf/tree/1.20.1-forge) branch.

Content is synchronized with Forge 1.1.3. The skin features and updated eye and Beast forearm textures are awaiting NeoForge gameplay testing.

Howling Werewolf is an independently developed transformation and progression Mod built around infection, lunar transformations, two progression systems, three werewolf forms, Hunters and Silver, Wolfsbane, and the Alpha Trial.

## Requirements

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| Minecraft Java Edition | 1.21.1 |
| Mod loader | NeoForge 21.1.248 or later compatible 21.1.x release |
| Java | 21 |
| Howling Werewolf | 1.1.3 |

## Werewolf skins

- Open the werewolf menu with **K** by default → **Skins** to choose from four coats: the original brown Adrian, gray Ashen with amber eyes, black Onyx with golden eyes, or white Ivory with red eyes. Each covers Werewolf, Quadruped Wolf, and Beast forms.
- Preview with mouse tracking, drag rotation, scroll-wheel zoom, and an equipment toggle, then apply your selection. Previewing does not unlock or activate a form. Level Reset is below the skill list on the Skill Tree page.
- Your selection persists through death, dimension changes, level resets, and curing/reawakening. Third-person rendering, inventory previews, and first-person claws share the same skin.
- Create a painting template and open Resource Packs from the skin screen to enable your own PNG skins. Reload edits with **F3 + T**. See the [custom skin guide](CUSTOM_SKINS.md) ([简体中文](CUSTOM_SKINS-zh.md)).

Update both server and clients to 1.1.3 for multiplayer. Only custom skin IDs are synchronized; observers need the same resource pack. Missing packs display Adrian while preserving the saved selection.

## Build from source

Download or clone this branch, then use the Gradle wrapper with a Java 21 toolchain:

```powershell
./gradlew.bat clean build
```

The distributable JAR is written to `build/libs/howlingwerewolf-1.1.3-neoforge.jar`.

## Release status

The previously released NeoForge edition completed a full gameplay test pass. The maintainer will verify the new skin UI, rendering, persistence, and multiplayer behavior in game.

Back up every important world before adding or updating any Mod.

## Administrator commands

Server operators and testers can consult the [administrator command guide](ADMIN_COMMANDS.md), also available in [Simplified Chinese](ADMIN_COMMANDS-zh.md).
